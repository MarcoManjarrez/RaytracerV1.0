# Usage
In order to create a render, you must first create a scene. This is done in the main method, where you must assign a camera, the objects you wish to be rendered, and the lights that will iluminate them. Some 3D object files are provided.
An example document illustrating how to assign these things in the main class is provided.

# Example
The following is an example of a scene made with the algorithm.
